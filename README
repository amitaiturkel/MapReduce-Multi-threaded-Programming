# MapReduce Multi-threaded Framework

## Overview

This project is a high-performance, multi-threaded implementation of the MapReduce programming model, designed to efficiently process large-scale datasets. Leveraging parallelism, the framework distributes tasks across multiple threads, ensuring optimized performance for compute-intensive operations.

### Authors

- **Amitai Turkel** 

## Project Structure

### Source Files

- **`Context.cpp`**  
  Implements the core context management, responsible for maintaining the state and environment in which the MapReduce operations are executed.

- **`WarpContext.cpp`**  
  Manages the warp context, which handles the execution environment for a specific group of threads, ensuring efficient task execution.

- **`Barrier.cpp`**  
  Provides the barrier synchronization mechanism, crucial for coordinating thread operations and ensuring that all threads reach synchronization points before proceeding.

- **`JobHandler.cpp`**  
  Oversees job lifecycle management, including the initialization, execution, and finalization of MapReduce jobs. This component handles the distribution of tasks and manages thread resources.

- **`MapReduceFramework.cpp`**  
  Contains the core implementation of the MapReduce framework, including the orchestration of map and reduce tasks, as well as the handling of intermediate data and results aggregation.

### Header Files

- **`Context.h`**  
  Declares the interfaces and structures for context management.

- **`WarpContext.h`**  
  Declares the interfaces for managing the warp context, ensuring that thread groups are handled efficiently.

- **`Barrier.h`**  
  Declares the barrier class, providing synchronization services essential for thread coordination.

- **`JobHandler.h`**  
  Declares the job handling interfaces, outlining the methods used for managing job execution and resource allocation.

- **`MapReduceFramework.h`**  
  Declares the core MapReduce framework interfaces, including methods for initiating and managing MapReduce tasks.

## Key Features

- **Multi-threaded Execution:**  
  The framework employs multiple threads to parallelize the map and reduce tasks, significantly improving performance on large datasets.

- **Custom Map and Reduce Functions:**  
  Users can define their own map and reduce functions, making the framework adaptable to various problem domains.

- **Thread Synchronization:**  
  The implementation includes robust synchronization mechanisms, such as barriers, to ensure data integrity and correct results across concurrent operations.

- **Modular Design:**  
  The project is organized into modular components, making it easy to extend and maintain.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amitaiturkel/MapReduce-Multi-threaded-Programming.git
   cd MapReduce-Multi-threaded-Programming
   ```

2. **Build the Project:**

   Use a C++ compiler like `g++`:

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++11 -pthread -o mapreduce Context.cpp WarpContext.cpp Barrier.cpp JobHandler.cpp MapReduceFramework.cpp
   ```

3. **Run the MapReduce Framework:**

   Execute the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./mapreduce
   ```

4. **Customize Map and Reduce Functions:**

   Modify the `MapReduceFramework.cpp` to include your own map and reduce functions, then recompile and run.
